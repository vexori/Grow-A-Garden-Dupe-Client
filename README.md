**Grow-A-Garden Dupe Client (Python)** ðŸŒ± An automatic duplication system for Grow a Garden â€” written in Python!

---

### âœ¨ Features

- Supports seeds, tools, water, fertilizer, and full-grown plants

### ðŸš€ How It Works

The script listens for in-game actions like planting or harvesting. When a valid action is detected, it briefly delays the sync signal sent to the server.
This causes the game to complete the action **without removing the item, effectively duplicating it**.
